> A high-performance, Redis-inspired in-memory database built from scratch in C++

Redis-X is a lightweight, production-ready in-memory database that implements core Redis functionality with modern C++ design patterns. Built as a learning project to understand distributed systems and database internals, it features efficient data structures, non-blocking I/O, and concurrent processing capabilities.

## ✨ Features

### 🔑 Basic Key-Value Operations
- **SET/GET/DEL** - Standard string operations with O(1) hash table lookups
- **KEYS** - Pattern-based key enumeration
- **PEXPIRE/PTTL** - Millisecond-precision TTL management with automatic expiration

### 📊 Advanced Data Structures
- **Sorted Sets (ZSET)** - Implemented with AVL trees for O(log n) operations:
  - `ZADD` - Add/update members with scores
  - `ZREM` - Remove members
  - `ZSCORE` - Get member scores
  - `ZQUERY` - Range queries with pagination

### ⚡ Performance & Concurrency
- **Non-blocking I/O** - Event-driven architecture using `poll()`
- **Thread Pool** - Background processing for large data structure operations
- **Progressive Rehashing** - Zero-downtime hash table resizing
- **Efficient Memory Management** - Custom allocators and RAII patterns

### 🏗️ Core Architecture
- **Hash Tables** - Fast O(1) key lookups with collision handling
- **AVL Trees** - Self-balancing binary trees for sorted operations

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Linux/macOS with GCC 7+ or Clang 5+
- POSIX-compliant system (for sockets and threading)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/redis-x.git
   cd redis-x
   ```

2. **Build the server and client**
   ```bash
   # Navigate to the latest implementation
   cd 11-thread-pool-production
   
   # Compile the server
   g++ -std=c++17 -O2 -pthread -o server \
       server.cpp hashtable.cpp avl.cpp zset.cpp heap.cpp thread_pool.cpp
   
   # Compile the client
   g++ -std=c++17 -O2 -o client client.cpp
   ```

3. **Run the server**
   ```bash
   ./server
   # Server starts on port 1234
   ```

4. **Connect with the client**
   ```bash
   ./client
   ```

## 📖 Usage Examples

### Basic Key-Value Operations
```bash
# Set a key-value pair
$ ./client set mykey "Hello World"
(nil)

# Get the value
$ ./client get mykey
(str) Hello World

# Set with TTL (5000ms)
$ ./client pexpire mykey 5000
(int) 1

# Check remaining TTL
$ ./client pttl mykey
(int) 3247

# Delete the key
$ ./client del mykey
(int) 1
```

### Sorted Sets Operations
```bash
# Add members to a sorted set
$ ./client zadd leaderboard 100 "alice"
(int) 1
$ ./client zadd leaderboard 200 "bob"
(int) 1
$ ./client zadd leaderboard 150 "charlie"
(int) 1

# Get member score
$ ./client zscore leaderboard "bob"
(dbl) 200

# Query range (score >= 100, limit 10)
$ ./client zquery leaderboard 100 "" 0 10
(arr) len=6
(str) alice
(dbl) 100
(str) charlie
(dbl) 150
(str) bob
(dbl) 200
(arr) end

# Remove a member
$ ./client zrem leaderboard "alice"
(int) 1
```

### Key Management
```bash
# List all keys
$ ./client keys
(arr) len=2
(str) leaderboard
(str) mykey
(arr) end
```

## 🏛️ Architecture Overview

### Event-Driven Server
Redis-X uses a single-threaded event loop with non-blocking I/O to handle thousands of concurrent connections efficiently:

- **Connection Management**: Each client connection is represented by a `Conn` struct with read/write buffers
- **Event Loop**: Uses `poll()` to monitor socket readiness and process I/O events
- **Request Processing**: Custom binary protocol with pipelining support
- **Timer Management**: Dual-timer system for connection timeouts and TTL expiration

### Data Structure Design
- **Hash Table**: Two-table progressive rehashing for zero-downtime resizing
- **AVL Tree**: Self-balancing for sorted set operations with O(log n) complexity
- **Min-Heap**: Efficient TTL expiration with O(log n) insert/delete operations
- **Memory Safety**: RAII patterns and smart pointer usage throughout

### Concurrency Model
- **Main Thread**: Handles all I/O and request processing
- **Thread Pool**: Background workers for expensive operations (large data structure cleanup)
- **Lock-Free Design**: Minimal locking with careful data structure design

## 🔮 Future Improvements

### 🚀 Production Features
- **Persistence Layer** - AOF (Append-Only File) and RDB snapshots
- **Replication** - Master-slave replication with failover
- **Clustering** - Distributed hash partitioning across nodes
- **Memory Optimization** - Custom memory allocators and compression

### ☁️ Deployment & Scaling
- **Docker Support** - Containerized deployment with health checks

- **Documentation** - API documentation and architecture deep-dives

## 🎯 Why I Built This

This project was born from a deep curiosity about how modern databases work under the hood. While using Redis in production environments, I found myself constantly wondering:

- *How does Redis achieve such incredible performance?*
- *What makes in-memory databases so fast?*
- *How do distributed systems handle concurrency and data consistency?*

Rather than just reading about these concepts, I decided to build my own Redis-like database from scratch to truly understand the internals. This hands-on approach taught me more about systems programming, data structures, and network programming than any textbook could.

## 🧠 What I Learned

### **Systems Programming Mastery**
- **Network Programming**: Deep dive into TCP sockets, non-blocking I/O, and event-driven architectures
- **Memory Management**: Understanding heap vs stack, RAII patterns, and avoiding memory leaks
- **Concurrency**: Thread pools, mutexes, condition variables, and lock-free programming techniques

### **Data Structure Implementation**
- **Hash Tables**: Built a production-quality hash table with progressive rehashing and collision handling
- **AVL Trees**: Implemented self-balancing binary trees for O(log n) sorted operations
- **Heaps**: Created efficient min-heap for TTL expiration management
- **Linked Lists**: Used for connection management and timeout handling

### **Performance Optimization**
- **Algorithm Complexity**: Learned when to use O(1) vs O(log n) vs O(n) operations
- **Memory Locality**: Understanding cache-friendly data structures and access patterns
- **I/O Efficiency**: Non-blocking operations and event loops for handling thousands of connections

### **Production Considerations**
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and graceful degradation
- **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup and resource deallocation
- **Scalability**: Designing for horizontal scaling and distributed systems
- **Monitoring**: Understanding what metrics matter in production environments

### **Software Engineering Practices**
- **Code Organization**: Modular design with clear separation of concerns
- **Testing**: Comprehensive testing strategies for systems software
- **Documentation**: Writing clear, maintainable code and documentation
- **Version Control**: Proper git workflow and commit practices

This project transformed my understanding of how databases work and gave me the confidence to tackle complex systems programming challenges. It's a testament to the power of learning by building!
